## How to evaluate if your code is good?

A 8-step checklist "from my head", without too much thinking.

1. **Is it bug proof?** Think about edge cases.

2. **Is it secure?** Check inputs, access, permissions.

3. **Is it fast?** What if you deal with 100x data?

4. **Is it clear?** Will juniors understand it without your help?

5. **Is it using tools well?** Do you use features of language/framework instead of workarounds?

6. **Is it flexible?** Parameters, no hardcoded values, OOP structure.

7. **Is it tested?** Both manually and automatically.

8. **Is it standard?** Does it align with the same code style and team guidelines in all the project.
